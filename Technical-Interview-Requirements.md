# Syberry Academy Technical Interview: Requirements

### Before you start
You must create a **private** repository named `Name-Surname-Academy-Technical-Interview` and add `SyberryAcademy` as Collaborator. <br>
Your repository must have the following structure: <br>

```
README.md
algorithms-task
  solution.[extension]
specialization-task
  [git folder]
```

**There must be two folders in your repository:**
_(It doesn't matter if you have completed one or two tasks)_

1. `algorithms-task` - this is the directory with the algorithms-task solution
2. `specialization-task` - this is the directory with the corresponding solution to the problem, depending on the programming language.

**Instruction to create this structure, follow these steps:**
1. Create a project
2. Initialize your git repository in the project root: `git init`
3. Create the `algorithms-task` directory
4. Copy the task from the git repository to the `specialization-task` directory, example: `git clone <link to the git task> specialization-task`
5. Go to directory `specialization-task` and delete the folder` .git`, this folder may be hidden.
6. Congratulations!

You may need to add a remote repository for your project, you can use the following command:
`git remote add origin <link to your repository>`

****
To the algorithms-task folder add `solution.[extension]` file. This file must contain the solution to the given task. Please note: your file `MUST` contain a `solution()` function. You may write as many functions as you want to solve the task, but we will check only this function. If the `solution()` function does not work, your task is considered as failed. <br>

Please be careful with pushing to `specialization-task` folder. Don't push into our repository!<br>

To specialization-task folder clone the repository with the specialization task (we'll send you an invite during the interview). <br>

Your last commit must have a comment 'Final commit' and must be no later than 2h 30minutes after interview starts.

Please send us an email when finished (to s.vasilieva@syberry.com).

We promise to grade your solution within 5 working days starting the day of your interview.

# Syberry Academy Technical Interview: Requirements

### Before you start
You must create a **private** repository named `Name-Surname-Academy-Technical-Interview` and add `SyberryAcademy` as Collaborator. <br>
Your repository must have the following structure: <br>

```
README.md
algorithms-task
  solution.[extension]
specialization-task
  [git folder]
```

To the algorithms-task folder add `solution.[extension]` file. This file must contain the solution to the given task. Please note: your file `MUST` contain a `solution()` function. You may write as many functions as you want to solve the task, but we will check only this function. If the `solution()` function does not work, your task is considered as failed. <br>

To specialization-task folder clone the repository with the specialization task (we'll send you an invite during the interview). <br>

Your last commit must have a comment 'Final commit' and must be no later than 2h 30minutes after interview starts.

Please send us an email when finished (to s.vasilieva@syberry.com or academy@syberry.com).

We promise to grade your solution within 5 working days strating the day of your interview.
